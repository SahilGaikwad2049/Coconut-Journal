                        Individual named Silvika (21F) (alias: Coconut, ht: 4'11", wt: 39kg) found dilly-dallying for the umpteenth time. Infamous for her silly nature (very aptly) and astute meows, she is now eyeballing another quick snack. While the Sandwizza outlets may hate to see her coming, Barfi and Khari do not. Apart from baking excellent cookies, she is said to be the archnemesis of Nausea. Any sightings or information regarding the subject's whereabouts should be reported, as our sources describe her as cute.
